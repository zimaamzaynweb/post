            <h1>Balancing Faith and Medicine</h1>
            <p class="author-info">By Zimaam Zayn</p>
        </div>

        <div class="article-content">
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>AoA, for me balancing faith and medicine became a part of life. As a medico at MRIMS, my life is a blend of academic pursuits, deep-rooted faith, and the occasional existential ponderings.</p>

            <h2>Act 1: The Beginning</h2>
            <p>My name is Zimaam Zayn, and I'm a medical student at MRIMS. Despite not being the most intelligent student, I find solace in writing notes, only to revisit them during exams or internals. These jotted pieces of wisdom often act as my saving grace for exams. My journey in medicine is accompanied by my three close friends, with Sohail Ali being the most significant. His light-hearted nature and realistic friendship are something I love in him, even if we don't spend much time together.</p>

            <p>I often feel like the dullest member among my intellectual siblings, feeling somewhat detached. My laid-back nature contrasts sharply with my intermittent spurts of extroversion around close friends. Planning goals is my forte, but achieving them just before deadlines or sometimes missing them altogether is my reality.</p>

            <h2>Act 2: The Struggle</h2>
            <p>Balancing my medical studies with my passion for screenwriting presents its own set of challenges. While I love the creative portal that screenwriting offers, I struggle with self-doubt, often questioning my capabilities compared to my more accomplished siblings. The only sense of purpose I find in myself is experiencing something new in writing or reading.</p>

            <p>My journey is further enriched by reading books, listening to Noman Ali Khan's audio Tafseer of the Quran, or watching some good dramas. These resources offer me spiritual nourishment or sometimes just a way to pass the time. I don't use my mobile for more than 30 minutes daily.</p>

            <h2>Act 3: The Harmony</h2>
            <p>Despite the struggles, I find a balance between my faith and medical practice. My daily routine includes moments of reflection and prayer, facing academic and personal challenges, and trying to write something new.</p>

            <p>My journey is one of personal growth and discovery. I have learned a lot from myself, from you guys, and mostly from those who say I am useless.</p>

            <h2>Climax: The Breakthrough</h2>
            <p>One breakthrough moment was when I successfully balanced my medical exams with completing a screenwriting project as a solo writer. The sense of accomplishment I felt was immense, and it reaffirmed my belief in my abilities to juggle both passions. Isn't that what we all want?</p>

            <h2>Resolution: The Final End</h2>
            <p>To my fellow medicos, I offer this piece of advice: balancing life is not easy, but it is immensely rewarding if you allow yourself to explore. Embrace the journey, learn from the challenges, and stay true to your beliefs. Don't just contribute positivity; at least be positive.</p>

            <p>"Life is a Balance between Holding on and Letting Go." ~ Rumi</p>

            <p>The future holds many possibilities, and I am excited to explore them, guided by my faith and fueled by my passion for medicine, reading, and screenwriting. Allah-hafiz...</p>
