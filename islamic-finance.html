<h1>Islamic Finance: Islamic Finance: Principles and Basics</h1>
            <p class="author-info">By Zimaam Zayn</p>
        </div>

      <div class="article-content">

<h2>Introduction:</h2>
<p>Over the past few decades, Muslims have sought to align finance with Islamic principles. Some believe removing interest makes finance charitable, but profit can still be earned within an Islamic framework.</p>

<h2><strong>Profit Without Interest</strong></h2>

<p>Excluding interest does not prevent financiers from earning profit. Islamic finance provides ethical alternatives that ensure commercial viability.</p>

<h2><strong>Islamic Finance vs. Capitalism</strong></h2>

<p>Islam acknowledges market economies but imposes ethical guidelines. In capitalism, unchecked profit motives allow interest, gambling, and speculative transactions, concentrating wealth among a few and distorting market forces.</p>

<h2><strong>Asset-Backed Finance</strong></h2>

<p>Islamic finance is always tied to real assets, unlike conventional finance, which deals mainly in money. Money itself has no intrinsic value and is merely a medium of exchange. Profit arises from transactions involving real goods or services.</p>

<h2><strong>Islamic Finance Methods</strong></h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Musharakah & Mudarabah:</strong> Financier invests money, and profits are generated through trade or business.</li>
  <li><strong>Salam:</strong> Financier purchases real goods and sells them for profit.</li>
  <li><strong>Istisna:</strong> Financing is linked to manufacturing goods, generating profit for the financier.</li>
  <li><strong>Murabahah:</strong> Financier buys a commodity and sells it at a profit, assuming ownership and risk before sale.</li>
  <li><strong>Leasing (Ijarah):</strong> Financier provides an asset, assuming risk throughout the lease period.</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>Risk Sharing in Islamic Finance</strong></h2>

<p>Unlike interest-based loans, where the lender has no concern for how funds are used, Islamic finance involves risk-sharing, in Musharakah and Mudarabah - Funds and Labour are at risk and in Murabahah and Ijarah:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Murabahah:</strong> The financier must own the asset before selling, ensuring the transaction is halal.</li>
  <li><strong>Ijarah:</strong> The financier bears the risk of leased property throughout the lease duration.</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>Capital & Entrepreneurship</strong></h2>

<p>Capitalism separates capital providers and entrepreneurs—one earns interest, while the other takes risks. Islam integrates them: anyone investing funds becomes a participant in the business and shares in its profits.</p>

<h2><strong>Challenges in Islamic Finance</strong></h2>

<p>Critics argue that Islamic finance has not brought major change. However:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Islamic financial institutions form only a small fraction of the global market.</li>
  <li>They are still in their early stages of development.</li>
  <li>Most Islamic banks lack government support.</li>
</ul>

<p>Despite these challenges, Islamic finance continues to grow as more people recognize its ethical and economic benefits.</p>

<h2><strong>Musharakah</strong></h2>

<p><em>Musharakah</em>, meaning "sharing" in Arabic, refers to a joint enterprise where partners share profits and losses. Unlike interest-based financing, where a fixed return is predetermined, musharakah distributes profits based on actual earnings.</p>

<h2><strong>Conventional vs. Islamic Financing</strong></h2>

<p>In conventional systems, industrialists may contribute only 10% of a project’s capital, while depositors provide 90%. Despite this, the industrialist reaps most of the profits, leaving depositors with a small return. Islamic finance requires financiers to either provide loans as humanitarian aid or share in both profits and losses.</p>

<h2><strong>Types of Musharakah (Shirkah)</strong></h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Shirkat-ul-Milk:</strong> Joint ownership of an asset.</li>
  <li><strong>Shirkat-ul-‘Aqd:</strong> A contractual partnership, further divided into:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Shirkat-ul-Amwal:</strong> All partners invest capital.</li>
      <li><strong>Shirkat-ul-A’mal:</strong> Partners provide services and share earnings.</li>
      <li><strong>Shirkat-ul-Wujooh:</strong> Partners invest no capital but purchase goods on credit and sell them at a profit.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Musharakah typically refers to Shirkat-ul-Amwal, where two or more parties invest capital in a joint commercial venture.</p>

<h2><strong>Basic Rules of Musharakah</strong></h2>

<ul>
  <li>A valid contract must be agreed upon by all parties.</li>
  <li>The profit-sharing ratio must be pre-agreed.</li>
  <li>Profit distribution must be based on actual profits, not a fixed amount or percentage of investment.</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>Profit and Loss Sharing</strong></h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Profit Distribution:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Imam Malik & Imam Shafi’i: Profit must be shared according to investment proportion. (Al-Mughni, 5:140)</li>
      <li>Imam Ahmad: Profit distribution can differ from investment proportion if mutually agreed. (Al-Mughni, 5:140)</li>
      <li>Imam Abu Hanifah: Profit ratios can differ unless a partner is a sleeping partner, in which case his profit share must match his investment proportion. (Bada’i‘ al-Sana’i‘, 6:162–63)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Loss Sharing:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Loss must be shared strictly according to investment proportion. (Al-Mughni, 5:147)</li>
      <li>Imam Shafi’i: Profit and loss ratios must match investment proportion.</li>
      <li>Imam Abu Hanifah & Imam Ahmad: Profit ratios may differ, but loss must always follow the capital ratio.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>Nature of Capital</strong></h2>

<ul>
  <li>Majority view: Capital must be in liquid (monetary) form.</li>
  <li>Imam Malik: Liquidity is not required, and contributions in kind are valid. (Al-Mughni, 5:125)</li>
  <li>Imam Abu Hanifah & Imam Ahmad: Capital should be in money form to ensure a true partnership. (Bada’i‘ al-Sana’i‘, 6:59)</li>
  <li>Imam al-Shafi’i: Differentiates between dhawat-ul-amthal (interchangeable commodities) and dhawat-ul-qeemah (unique goods). Only dhawat-ul-amthal can be part of musharakah capital. (Al-Mughni, 5:125)</li>
  <li>Imam Malik: Allows commodity contributions without restriction, determining shares by market value at the contract's start, making his view practical for modern business.</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>Management of Musharakah</strong></h2>

<p>By default, all partners have the right to manage. Partners may agree that only one manages, making others sleeping partners, who are entitled to profit only in proportion to their investment.</p>

<h2><strong>Termination of Musharakah:</strong></h2>

<ul>
  <li>Any partner can terminate the musharakah with notice. If assets are in cash, they are distributed pro rata. If not liquidated, partners can agree on liquidation or distribution. If disputed, non-liquid assets distribution is preferred, as a co-owner can seek partition.</li>
  <li>If a partner dies, the musharakah terminates. The deceased's heirs can either withdraw the share or continue the contract.</li>
  <li>If a partner becomes insane or incapable of commercial transactions, the musharakah terminates. (Al-Mughni, 5:133–34)</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>Termination Of Musharakah Without Closing Business:</strong></h2>

<p>If one of the partners wants to terminate the musharakah while others wish to continue, they may purchase the leaving partner’s share by mutual agreement. The share’s price must be determined by consent. If there is a dispute, the leaving partner may compel liquidation or distribution.</p>

<p>A condition can be agreed upon at the beginning of the musharakah that liquidation or separation will not occur unless all or a majority of partners agree. A single partner wishing to exit must sell their share to other partners and cannot force liquidation. Hanbali jurists permit this. (See Al-Insaf - Al-Mardavi)</p>

<h2><strong>MUDARABAH:</strong></h2>

<p><em>Mudarabah</em> is a special partnership where one partner (rabb-ul-mal) provides capital, and the other (mudarib) manages the business.</p>

<p>A rabb-ul-mal can contract mudarabah with multiple mudaribs through a single transaction, and they will jointly use the capital. The mudarib’s share is divided among them as agreed. (Al-Mughni 5:145)</p>

<h2><strong>Differences Between Musharakah and Mudarabah:</strong></h2>

<ul>
  <li>In musharakah, all partners contribute capital, while in mudarabah, only the rabb-ul-mal invests.</li>
  <li>In musharakah, all partners may manage, while in mudarabah, only the mudarib manages.</li>
  <li>In musharakah, losses are shared per investment ratio; in mudarabah, only the rabb-ul-mal bears losses unless the mudarib is negligent or dishonest.</li>
  <li>Musharakah partners have unlimited liability, while in mudarabah, the rabb-ul-mal's liability is limited unless debts are permitted.</li>
  <li>In musharakah, all partners own assets jointly, benefiting from appreciation even before sales.</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>Distribution of Profit:</strong></h2>

<p>The profit-sharing ratio must be agreed upon at the start, with no fixed proportion required by Shari‘ah. Different ratios may be set for different situations. Apart from profit-sharing, the mudarib cannot claim a salary or fee. All Islamic Fiqh schools agree on this, though Imam Ahmad allows the mudarib to cover daily food expenses from the mudarabah account. (Al-Mughni, 5:186)</p>

<p>If the business incurs a loss but gains profit in another transaction, the profit first covers the loss, and any remaining amount is shared between the parties. (Al-Mughni, 5:168)</p>

<h2><strong>Termination Of Mudarabah:</strong></h2>

<p>Either party can terminate the mudarabah at any time by giving notice. If assets are in cash and profit is earned, it is distributed. If assets are not in cash, the mudarib is given time to sell and liquidate them.</p>

<p>Hanafi and Hanbali schools allow setting a fixed term (e.g., six months or one year) for mudarabah, after which it ends automatically. However, this is optional and not mandatory.</p>

<p>Either party can end the contract at any time, but early termination by the rabb-ul-mal may harm the project, especially in its initial stages.</p>

<p>Partners can agree not to terminate mudarabah for a specific period unless certain conditions arise. This does not contradict Shari‘ah principles.</p>

<h2><strong>MUSHARAKAH & MUDARABAH AS MODES OF FINANCE:</strong></h2>

<p>Musharakah and mudarabah are traditionally used for joint ventures where all partners participate from inception until closure. However, they can also finance running businesses if applied correctly.</p>

<h2><strong>Key principles:</strong></h2>

<ul>
  <li>Financing through musharakah or mudarabah is not a loan but a participation in business.</li>
  <li>Investors must share in business losses.</li>
  <li>Profit-sharing ratios are set by mutual agreement.</li>
  <li>Loss-sharing must match each partner’s investment proportion.</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>Project Financing:</strong></h2>

<p>Musharakah and mudarabah can be used for project financing. If the financier funds the entire project, mudarabah applies. If both parties invest, musharakah is used, with one party managing the business.</p>

<p>If the financier wishes to exit, the other party can buy out their share at an agreed price or bring in a new investor.</p>

<h2><strong>SECURITIZATION OF MUSHARAKAH:</strong></h2>

<p>Musharakah is useful for large projects needing substantial funds. Investors receive musharakah certificates representing their ownership share in the assets. Once the project acquires significant non-liquid assets, these certificates can be traded in the secondary market. However, trading is not permitted when all assets remain liquid.</p>

<p>Musharakah certificates represent direct pro rata ownership in project assets. When funds are used to acquire non-liquid assets like land, buildings, or machinery, certificate holders proportionately own these assets. If assets are a mix of liquid and non-liquid, Shafi’i scholars restrict trading, whereas Hanafi scholars allow trading if the liquid portion is minor.</p>

<h2><strong>Financing on Single Transaction:</strong></h2>

<p>Musharakah and mudarabah can also be applied to individual transactions. For instance, an importer may seek financing for a single trade, where ownership of goods is shared based on investment ratio. Similarly, in export financing, where the sale price is predetermined, expected profits can be estimated. The financier may require the exporter to handle logistics, absolving them from potential loss.</p>

<h2><strong>Financing on Working Capital:</strong></h2>

<p>Business capital can be evaluated with mutual consent, treating the financier’s investment as a proportionate ownership share. At the end of the term, a reassessment of all liquid and non-liquid assets determines profit distribution. Though traditional principles require liquidation to determine profit, mutual consent allows asset valuation as a “constructive liquidation.”</p>

<h2><strong>Sharing in the Gross Profit Only:</strong></h2>

<p>Industries with large fixed assets face difficulties in profit calculation due to indirect expenses like depreciation and salaries. Instead of net profit, gross profit can be distributed, with adjustments in the financier’s profit share to compensate for the use of machinery, buildings, and staff.</p>

<p>The client may also charge an agreed rent for using their assets, independent of profit or loss. Alternatively, the financier’s profit ratio may be increased instead of paying rent, an approach justified by Imam Ahmad ibn Hanbal’s analogy.</p>

<h2><strong>Running Musharakah Account on the Basis of Daily Products:</strong></h2>

<p>Many financial institutions finance working capital by maintaining a running account. Debits and credits continue up to the maturity date. A suggested approach for musharakah or mudarabah financing includes:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A set percentage of actual profit as management fees.</li>
  <li>The remaining profit goes to investors.</li>
  <li>Any loss is borne by investors.</li>
  <li>Profit at the end of the term is calculated on a daily product basis.</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>Diminishing Musharakah:</strong></h2>

<p>Diminishing musharakah involves a financier’s share being divided into units, which the client purchases periodically until full ownership is transferred.</p>

<h2><strong>Steps for House Financing Based on Diminishing Musharakah:</strong></h2>

<ol>
  <li>Creating joint ownership (Shirkat-al-Milk).</li>
  <li>Renting the financier’s share to the client.</li>
  <li>The client promises to purchase the financier’s share units over time.</li>
  <li>The client gradually purchases the units.</li>
  <li>Rental adjustments based on the financier’s remaining share.</li>
</ol>

<h2><strong>Diminishing Musharakah for Service Businesses:</strong></h2>

<p>For example, purchasing a taxi for hire under diminishing musharakah follows the same steps. However, depreciation must be considered when determining unit prices.</p>

<h2><strong>Diminishing Musharakah in Trade</strong></h2>

<p>Diminishing Musharakah is a partnership where two partners invest different amounts in a business. Over time, the client buys the financier's share in the partnership. However, the price of these shares cannot be fixed in advance, as that would guarantee the financier’s capital, which is not allowed in Musharakah.</p>

<p>The financier has two ways to price the units:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Valuation-Based Pricing</strong> – The price depends on the business’s value at the time of purchase, which may change over time.</li>
  <li><strong>Fixed Price with Resale Option</strong> – The client can resell the units at any price to others but can only sell them back to the financier at a fixed price.</li>
</ul>

<p>Although both methods are allowed under Shari'ah, the second option is impractical. If the client sells shares to someone else, it could bring in new partners, making it harder for the financier to get back their investment. For this reason, the first option is the preferred choice in Diminishing Musharakah.</p>

<h2><strong>Murabahah (Cost-Plus Sale)</strong></h2>

<p><em>Murabahah</em> is a common Islamic financing method where the seller discloses the cost of a product and adds a fixed profit margin. The key difference from other sales is transparency—both the cost and profit are clearly stated.</p>

<p>If the seller does not disclose the cost and only sets a final price, the sale is called Musawamah (negotiation or bargaining), not Murabahah.</p>

<h2><strong>Basic Rules of Sale</strong></h2>

<ul>
  <li>The item must exist at the time of sale.</li>
  <li>The seller must own the item when selling it.</li>
  <li>The seller must have possession of the item (physically or legally).</li>
  <li>The sale must be final and not depend on future events.</li>
  <li>The item must have value and should not be used for haram purposes.</li>
  <li>The item must be clearly described.</li>
  <li>The buyer must be guaranteed to receive the item.</li>
  <li>The price must be fixed and certain.</li>
  <li>The sale must be unconditional (e.g., no extra promises like a job offer upon purchase).</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>Bai Mu'ajjal (Deferred Payment Sale)</strong></h2>

<p><em>Bai Mu'ajjal</em> is a sale where payment is delayed.</p>

<ul>
  <li>It is valid only if the payment due date is clear.</li>
  <li>If the timing is uncertain, the sale is invalid.</li>
  <li>If a time period (e.g., one month) is set, it starts from delivery unless agreed otherwise.</li>
  <li>The deferred price can be higher than the cash price but must be fixed at the time of sale.</li>
  <li>The buyer may promise a charitable donation if they miss a payment (to encourage timely payment).</li>
  <li>The seller can ask for collateral (such as a mortgage or security) to ensure payment.</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>Murabahah as a Financing Method</strong></h2>

<p><em>Murabahah</em> was originally not meant as a financing tool but is now used to replace interest-based loans in an Islamic way.</p>

<h2><strong>Conditions for Murabahah Financing:</strong></h2>

<ul>
  <li><em>Murabahah</em> is not a loan with interest; it is a sale with a profit margin.</li>
  <li>Since it is a sale, it must follow all rules of a valid sale.</li>
  <li>It can only be used if the client needs funds to buy an actual product.</li>
  <li>The financier must own the product before selling it to the client.</li>
  <li>The financier must take possession of the product (physically or legally) and bear its risk before selling it.</li>
</ul>

<p>A financial institution can use Murabahah for financing by following these steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Agreement</strong> – The institution and client sign a general agreement where the institution agrees to sell and the client agrees to buy commodities with an agreed profit margin.</li>
  <li><strong>Agency Appointment</strong> – When the client needs a specific commodity, the institution appoints the client as its agent to purchase it.</li>
  <li><strong>Purchase on Behalf of Institution</strong> – The client buys the commodity on behalf of the institution and takes possession as its agent.</li>
  <li><strong>Offer to Purchase</strong> – The client informs the institution and offers to buy the commodity from the institution.</li>
  <li><strong>Sale Conclusion</strong> – The institution accepts the offer, and the sale is finalized.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Important Condition:</strong> The commodity must be bought from a third party. A 'buy-back' agreement, where the institution purchases the commodity from the client, is not allowed under Shari’ah, as it resembles an interest-based transaction.</p>

<h2><strong>Issues in Murabahah</strong></h2>

<h2><strong>Different Pricing for Cash and Credit Sales</strong></h2>

<p>The financier buys the commodity with cash and sells it on credit, adjusting the price based on the payment period.</p>

<p>Longer payment terms result in a higher price, making Murabahah-based sales more expensive than cash market prices.</p>

<p>Since Islam treats money and commodities differently, this markup is not considered interest.</p>

<h2><strong>Using Interest-Rate as Benchmark</strong></h2>

<p>Many financial institutions determine Murabahah profit using interest-rate benchmarks like LIBOR.</p>

<p>While not ideal, this practice is still used due to market conditions.</p>

<p>Islamic finance institutions should move away from this model to develop interest-free financial mechanisms.</p>

<h2><strong>Promise to Purchase</strong></h2>

<p>If the client is not obligated to buy the commodity after the financier has purchased it, the financier risks losses.</p>

<p>To mitigate this risk, Murabahah contracts often include a binding promise from the client to buy the commodity after the financier acquires it.</p>

<h2><strong>The Legal Status of a Promise in Murabahah</strong></h2>

<p>The fuqaha’ (Muslim jurists) have different views on the subject:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Non-Mandatory View:</strong> Many jurists believe that fulfilling a promise is commendable but not mandatory or enforceable in court. This view is attributed to Imam Abu Hanifah, Imam al-Shafi’i, and Imam Ahmad. (Umdat al-Qari, 12:121)</li>
  <li><strong>Mandatory View:</strong> Some scholars, including Samurah ibn Jundub, Umar ibn Abd al-Aziz, Hasan al-Basri, and Imam al-Bukhari, consider fulfilling a promise legally binding. (Sahih al-Bukhari, Kitab al-Shahadat)</li>
</ul>

<p>The Qur’an emphasizes fulfilling promises: "And fulfill the covenant. Surely, the covenant will be asked about (in the Hereafter)." (Bani Isra’il: 34)</p>

<p>Imam Abu Bakr al-Jassas states that this verse implies that if one undertakes a commitment, it becomes obligatory. (Ahkam al-Qur’an, 3:420)</p>

<p>The Islamic Fiqh Academy (Jeddah) ruled that commercial promises are binding if:</p>

<ul>
  <li>It is a one-sided promise.</li>
  <li>The promise causes the other party to incur liabilities.</li>
  <li>The promise itself does not constitute the final sale.</li>
</ul>

<p>If the promisor backs out, the court can force them to purchase the commodity or pay actual damages, but not opportunity costs. (Resolution no. 2 and 3, Fifth Conference, Kuwait, 1409 AH)</p>

<h2><strong>Securities Against Murabahah Price</strong></h2>

<p>Since Murabahah is a deferred payment sale, financiers require security to ensure payment. The security can be:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Mortgage, hypothecation, lien, or charge.</li>
  <li>The sold commodity itself, but only after the purchaser has taken possession.</li>
</ul>

<p>According to the Hanafi School, security must be explicitly agreed upon. The Shafi’i and Hanbali jurists rule that if a pledged asset is damaged due to negligence, the mortgagee bears the loss. Otherwise, the purchaser is responsible and must pay the full price. (Al-Mughni, 4:442)</p>

<h2><strong>Guaranteeing the Murabahah</strong></h2>

<p>In murabahah financing, the seller can require the purchaser to provide a third-party guarantee. If the purchaser defaults, the guarantor becomes liable for the payment. However, in modern commercial settings, guarantors often charge a fee, whereas classical fiqh unanimously considers guarantees a voluntary service that cannot be monetized. Finding free guarantors is challenging, so some contemporary scholars argue that this prohibition is not directly from the Qur’an or Sunnah but rather derived from the prohibition of riba.</p>

<h2><strong>Penalty for Default</strong></h2>

<p>If a client fails to pay on time, the price cannot be increased. Once fixed, the murabahah price remains unchanged. Some clients exploit this rule by intentionally delaying payments. To address this, scholars suggest a compensation method tied to the bank’s profit distribution:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A grace period of at least one month should be given, with weekly warnings.</li>
  <li>If the client’s default is due to poverty, no penalty can be charged, as per the Qur’an (2:280).</li>
  <li>Compensation is only valid if the bank's investment account has generated profits for depositors.</li>
</ul>

<p>The Prophet ﷺ condemned unjustified delays in payment, stating: “The well-off person who delays payment subjects himself to punishment and disgrace.” (Sahih al-Bukhari, hadith no. 2400). However, Imam al-Shafi’i held that while rent for usurped land must be paid, money usurped is returned as is, indicating that opportunity cost is not recognized in Islamic law.</p>

<h2><strong>Alternative Approach</strong></h2>

<p>Instead of charging a penalty as income, the client can pledge to donate a specified amount to a charitable fund if they default. This fund, maintained by the bank, is used solely for charitable purposes. Since this is a self-imposed commitment rather than a financier-imposed penalty, it is legally enforceable. The penalty clause should follow this format:</p>

<p>"The client hereby undertakes that if he defaults in payment of any of his dues under this agreement, he shall pay to the charitable account/fund maintained by the Bank/Financier a sum calculated at ...% per annum for each day of default, unless he provides satisfactory evidence that non-payment was due to poverty or factors beyond his control." (From Taqi Usmani Ustad's Book)</p>

<h2><strong>No Roll Over in Murabahah</strong></h2>

<p>In conventional finance, if a client cannot pay on time, the bank may extend the facility under new terms. However, murabahah is a sale, not a loan, so the seller can only claim the agreed price. The same commodity cannot be resold between the same parties.</p>

<h2><strong>Rebate on Early Payment</strong></h2>

<p>If a debtor wishes to repay early, they may seek a discount. Most jurists, including the four major schools, prohibit making this a contractual condition (Al-Mughni, 4:174–75).</p>

<p>Some scholars permit it, citing a hadith where the Prophet ﷺ said: “Give a discount and receive (your debts) soon.” (Al-Sunan al-Kubra, 6:28). However, the majority reject this hadith as weak, with even Imam al-Baihaqi acknowledging its unreliability. The Islamic Fiqh Academy also prohibits this (Resolution no. 66, VIth Session, Jeddah).</p>

<p>Thus, in murabahah financing, rebates cannot be contractually stipulated, but if the bank voluntarily grants a rebate—especially for needy clients—it is permissible.</p>

<h2><strong>Rescheduling Payments in Murabahah</strong></h2>

<p>If a client cannot pay on time, they may request rescheduling. Unlike conventional banks, which charge additional interest, Islamic banks cannot increase the amount. The murabahah price remains the same in the original currency.</p>

<p>Some clients misuse murabahah agreements to obtain funds without genuine purchases. To ensure the legitimacy of transactions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Payments should go directly to the supplier instead of the client.</li>
  <li>If funds are given to the client, they must present invoices or proof of purchase.</li>
  <li>If neither is possible, the financier should arrange a physical inspection of the purchased goods.</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>Ijarah (Islamic Leasing)</strong></h2>

<h2><strong>Definition:</strong></h2>

<p>"<em>Ijarah</em>" is an Islamic fiqh term that lexically means "to give something on rent." In jurisprudence, it applies to two situations:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Employment Contracts: Hiring a person for their services in exchange for wages. The employer is called musta’jir, and the employee is called ajir.</li>
  <li>Leasing of Assets: Transferring the usufruct (right to use) of an asset or property to another person in exchange for rent. The lessor is called mu’jir, the lessee is musta’jir, and the rent is ujrah.</li>
</ul>

<p>For Islamic banking, the second type—leasing of assets—is more relevant as both an investment and financing tool. Leasing is similar to a sale, except that ownership of the leased asset remains with the lessor, while only its usufruct is transferred to the lessee.</p>

<h2><strong>Basic Rules of Leasing (Ijarah)</strong></h2>

<ul>
  <li>Definition: Leasing is a contract where the owner transfers the right to use an asset to another person for a fixed period in return for rent.</li>
  <li>Usability: The leased asset must have a valid, beneficial use.</li>
  <li>Ownership & Usufruct: The ownership (raqabah) of the leased property remains with the lessor, while only its usufruct is transferred. Items that are consumed upon use (e.g., food, fuel) cannot be leased.</li>
  <li>Liability Distribution:
    <ul>
      <li>The lessor bears ownership-related liabilities (e.g., major repairs, taxes).</li>
      <li>The lessee bears liabilities related to usage (e.g., minor maintenance, operating costs).</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Fixed Lease Period: The duration must be clearly defined in the contract.</li>
  <li>Usage Restrictions:
    <ul>
      <li>The lessee must use the asset only for the agreed purpose.</li>
      <li>If no purpose is specified, it can be used in any normal manner.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Lessee’s Responsibility: The lessee must compensate the lessor for any damage caused by misuse or negligence.</li>
  <li>Lessor’s Risk: The asset remains at the lessor’s risk, meaning losses from unforeseen circumstances (e.g., natural disasters) are the lessor’s responsibility.</li>
  <li>Joint Ownership Leasing: A co-owner can lease their share only to their co-owner, not to a third party (Radd al-Muhtar, 6:47).</li>
  <li>Fixed Rent: The rental amount must be determined at the time of the contract for the entire lease period.</li>
  <li>No Unilateral Rent Increases: The lessor cannot increase rent without mutual consent.</li>
  <li>Lease Commencement: The lease begins once the asset is delivered, regardless of whether the lessee has started using it.</li>
  <li>Lease Termination: If the asset becomes completely unusable beyond repair, the lease is automatically terminated.</li>
</ul>

<h2><strong>Lease as a Mode of Financing</strong></h2>

<p>Like Murabahah, leasing (Ijarah) is not originally intended as a mode of financing. It is primarily a transaction for transferring the usufruct of an asset from one party to another for an agreed period in exchange for rent. However, in modern Islamic finance, leasing has been adapted as a structured financial tool while adhering to Shari‘ah principles.</p>

<h2><strong>Key Aspects of Ijarah in Financing</strong></h2>

  <li><strong>Commencement of Lease:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Unlike a sale contract, an Ijarah agreement can be made for a future date.</li>
      <li>While forward sales are prohibited in Shari‘ah, a lease agreement for a future date is allowed, provided that rent is payable only after the lessee has received the asset.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Different Relationship at Different Stages:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Before delivery, the relationship between the parties is that of a principal (lessor) and agent (lessee).</li>
      <li>Once the lessee takes delivery, the lease contract becomes effective, and the relationship shifts to that of a lessor and lessee.</li>
      <li>These two stages must not be confused or mixed.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Ownership-Related Expenses:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Since the lessor owns the asset, they are responsible for all costs incurred during its purchase and transportation, such as freight and customs duties.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Liability of the Parties:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>The lessee is liable for damages resulting from misuse or negligence.</li>
      <li>The lessee is also responsible for normal wear and tear during usage.</li>
      <li>However, losses caused by factors beyond the lessee’s control must be borne by the lessor.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Variable Rentals in Long-Term Leases:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>Fixing a single rental amount for long-term leases may not be beneficial due to changing market conditions.</li>
      <li>Then lessor has two options:
        <ul>
          <li>(a) Set a predetermined rental increase (e.g., 5%) at specified intervals (e.g., annually).</li>
          <li>(b) Enter into a short-term lease with the possibility of renewal at new terms.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Penalty for Late Payment of Rent:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>In conventional financial leases, penalties for late payments often increase the lessor’s income, which is not permissible in Shari‘ah.</li>
      <li>Instead, the lessee may undertake to pay a penalty that will be donated to charity if they delay payment.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Termination of Lease:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>If the lessee violates any lease terms, the lessor has the unilateral right to terminate the contract.</li>
      <li>If no violation occurs, the lease can only be terminated with mutual consent.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Insurance of Assets:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>If the leased asset is insured under Takaful (Islamic insurance), the cost must be borne by the lessor.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Post-Lease Asset Ownership:</strong>
    <ul>
<li>The asset remains the property of the lessor after the lease ends. If the lessee wishes to retain control of the asset, they cannot demand compensation for giving it up. Shari‘ah prohibits linking two separate transactions as a pre-condition (e.g., making lease termination conditional upon payment). The lessor may either reclaim the asset or renew the lease at the end of the contract.</li>
</ul>
</li>  <li><strong>Sub-Leasing:</strong>
     <ul>
	    <li>If an asset is suitable for multiple types of usage, the lessee cannot sub-lease it to another party without explicit permission from the lessor.</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li><strong>Assigning the Lease:</strong>
    <ul>
<li>The lessor has the right to sell the leased asset to a third party. Upon sale, the new owner steps into the role of the lessor, and the relationship of lessor-lessee transfers accordingly.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<h2>Head-Lease:</h2>

<p>In modern leasing, head-leasing is a concept where a lessee sub-leases the property to multiple sub-lessees. The lessee then invites others to invest in these sub-leases, charging a fee for participation in rental income. This arrangement is not compliant with Shari‘ah because the lessee does not own the asset or its usufruct after sub-leasing it.</p>

<h2>Salam and Istisna’ as Modes of Sale and Financing</h2>

<h3>General Rule for Sales in Shari‘ah:</h3>

<p>For a sale to be valid in Shari‘ah, three key conditions must be met:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The commodity must exist.</li>
  <li>The seller must own the commodity.</li>
  <li>The commodity must be in the seller’s possession, either physically or constructively.</li>
</ul>

<p>However, Shari‘ah allows two exceptions: Salam and Istisna’.</p>

<h3>1) Salam (Forward Sale with Advance Payment)</h3>

<p>Salam is a sale where the seller commits to delivering a specific commodity at a future date, while the buyer pays the full price upfront. This was permitted by the Prophet ﷺ to assist farmers and traders needing capital but unable to take interest-based loans.</p>

<h4>Conditions for Salam:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>The full price must be paid at the time of contract execution.</li>
  <li>The commodity must be measurable and clearly defined in terms of quality and quantity.</li>
  <li>The delivery date and place must be explicitly specified.</li>
  <li>Salam cannot apply to items that must be delivered on the spot (e.g., cash transactions).</li>
</ul>

<h4>Salam as a Mode of Financing:</h4>

<p>Salam serves as a financing tool for small farmers and traders. The price in Salam contracts is usually lower than the spot market price, allowing financial institutions to earn a profit. The seller may be required to provide a security or guarantee to ensure timely delivery.</p>

<h4>Ways Financial Institutions Benefit from Salam:</h4>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Parallel Salam:</strong> The institution purchases a commodity via Salam and sells it through another Salam contract with a shorter delivery period. Since the second price is slightly higher, the difference becomes the institution’s profit.</li>
  <li><strong>Third-Party Purchase Commitment:</strong> If a Parallel Salam contract is not feasible, the institution may secure a unilateral promise from a third party to buy the goods upon delivery. This allows the institution to pre-agree on a sale price without requiring an advance payment from the third party.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Rules of Parallel Salam:</h4>

<ul>
  <li>The financial institution must engage in two separate contracts: one as a buyer, the other as a seller.</li>
  <li>The original seller in the first Salam contract cannot be the buyer in the parallel contract, as this would constitute a prohibited buy-back arrangement.</li>
</ul>

<h3>2) Istisna’ (Manufacturing Contract)</h3>

<p>Istisna’ refers to a contract where a purchaser orders the manufacturing of a specified item at an agreed price. The manufacturer is under a moral obligation to produce the item, but the contract remains cancellable until manufacturing begins but a prior notice is given. (Radd al-Muhtar, 5:223)</p>

<h4>Differences Between Istisna’ and Salam:</h4>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Type of Goods:</strong> Istisna’ applies only to manufactured goods. Salam applies to all measurable commodities, whether they require manufacturing or not.</li>
  <li><strong>Payment Terms:</strong> In Salam, full payment must be made upfront. In Istisna’, payment can be deferred or made in installments.</li>
  <li><strong>Contract Cancellation:</strong> A Salam contract, once executed, cannot be canceled unilaterally. An Istisna’ contract can be canceled before manufacturing begins.</li>
  <li><strong>Delivery Time:</strong> In Salam, the delivery date must be fixed. In Istisna’, it is not necessary to specify an exact delivery date, though a maximum timeframe may be set.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Right to Reject Goods in Istisna’</h4>

<p>According to Imam Abu Hanifah, the buyer retains the option of seeing (khiyar-ur-ru’yah), meaning they can reject the goods upon inspection. Imam Abu Yusuf disagrees, ruling that if the manufactured goods meet the agreed specifications, the buyer is obligated to accept them.</p>

<h4>Delivery Timing in Istisna’</h4>

<p>While setting a delivery time is not mandatory, the buyer may impose a maximum delivery period. If the manufacturer exceeds this period, the buyer is not obligated to accept the goods.</p>

<h4>Istisna’ as a Mode of Financing</h4>

<p>One of the most significant applications of Istisna’ is in the housing finance sector. If a client already owns land and requires financing for the construction of a house, the financier may agree to construct the house on that land under an Istisna’ contract. If the client does not own land and wishes to acquire both land and a house, the financier may undertake to provide a fully constructed house on a specified piece of land.</p>

<p>Since Istisna’ does not require the price to be paid in advance or at the time of delivery (Sharh al-Majallah, 2:40), the payment schedule can be structured flexibly. It can be agreed upon in lump sum or installments. Additionally, the financier is not required to construct the house personally. Instead, they can enter into a parallel Istisna’ contract with a third-party contractor to fulfill the construction obligation.</p>

<h2>Islamic Investment Funds</h2>

<p>An Islamic Investment Fund is a collective investment pool where investors contribute surplus capital for Shari‘ah-compliant investments with the goal of earning halal profits.</p>

<h3>The key distinguishing features of Islamic investment funds are:</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Profit-Sharing Basis:</strong> Unlike conventional fixed-return investments, these funds operate on a profit-sharing model. The investors' returns are based on the actual profits earned by the fund. Neither the principal nor a fixed rate of return can be guaranteed.</li>
  <li><strong>Shari‘ah-Compliant Investments:</strong> The pooled funds must only be invested in businesses that conform to Shari‘ah principles, avoiding interest-based and prohibited activities.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Equity Funds in Islamic Finance</h2>

<p>Equity funds invest in the shares of joint stock companies, generating profits through capital gains and dividends.</p>

<h3>Shari‘ah Compliance in Stock Investments</h3>

<p>Islamic scholars generally agree that a company’s shares can be traded if:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The company’s core business is halal.</li>
  <li>The company does not engage in interest-based borrowing or investing.</li>
</ul>

<p>However, some companies mix halal and haram elements, such as keeping surplus funds in interest-bearing accounts or investing in interest-based securities.</p>

<h3>Scholarly Debate on Mixed-Income Companies</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Strict Prohibition View:</strong> Some scholars argue that investing in such companies is impermissible. Since every shareholder is technically a sharīk (partner), they indirectly approve the company’s haram activities by holding shares.</li>
  <li><strong>Lenient View (Majority Opinion):</strong> Many contemporary scholars differentiate between a joint stock company and a traditional partnership. In a corporation, decisions are made by a majority vote, meaning individual shareholders do not have control over financial policies. If a company’s primary business is halal, but it incidentally earns interest from surplus funds, this does not render the entire business unlawful. This perspective allows investment in such companies under certain conditions, provided that efforts are made to purify any haram income.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Conditions for Investment in Shares</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Shari‘ah-Compliant Business:</strong> The company’s primary business must not violate Shari‘ah principles.</li>
  <li><strong>Objection to Interest-Based Dealings:</strong> If a company engages in halal business (e.g., automobiles, textiles) but deposits surplus funds in interest-bearing accounts or borrows on interest, shareholders must express their disapproval. Ideally, they should voice objections at the company’s Annual General Meeting (AGM).</li>
  <li><strong>Purification of Interest-Based Earnings:</strong> If the company earns interest-based income, shareholders must calculate the proportion of interest in their dividends and donate that amount to charity.</li>
  <li><strong>Trading Restrictions Based on Asset Composition:</strong> If all a company’s assets are in liquid form (i.e., cash or cash equivalents), its shares can only be traded at par value. Some scholars allow trading if at least 33% of the company’s assets are illiquid (e.g., real estate, machinery).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Islamic Equity Funds</h2>

<p>Based on these conditions, Shari‘ah-compliant share trading is permissible, allowing for the establishment of Islamic Equity Funds. Subscribers to such funds are treated as partners, and their pooled capital is invested in compliant stocks. Profits are generated either through:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Dividends distributed by companies.</li>
  <li>Capital gains from selling shares at a higher price.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Purification Process</h3>

<p>Any earnings from non-permissible sources (e.g., bank interest) must be removed through purification. Scholars differ on whether capital gains from stock trading require purification:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>First Opinion (Preferred View):</strong> Purification is necessary since a company’s share price may reflect interest-based earnings.</li>
  <li><strong>Second Opinion:</strong> No purification is needed for capital gains, as interest-based earnings cannot be precisely separated. (The first view is stronger and avoids doubt.)</li>
</ul>

<h3>Fund Management Structures</h3>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Mudarabah-Based Management:</strong> Fund managers act as mudāribs (entrepreneurs) for the investors. Their compensation is a percentage of profits—if the fund earns no profit, the managers receive nothing. The managers’ share increases as the fund’s profits grow.</li>
  <li><strong>Agency-Based Management:</strong> The fund managers act as agents (wakils) for the investors. They receive a fixed fee (either lump sum, monthly, or annual). Shari‘ah scholars allow a fee based on a percentage of the fund’s net asset value (NAV) (e.g., 2% or 3%).</li>
</ul>

<h2>Other Types of Islamic Investment Funds</h2>

<h3>1. Ijarah Fund (Leasing Fund)</h3>

<p>Uses pooled investments to acquire assets like real estate, vehicles, or machinery for leasing. Fund subscribers receive sukuk (certificates) representing proportional ownership in leased assets. Rental income is distributed among investors.</p>

<h4>Key Shari‘ah Rules for Ijarah Funds:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>The leased asset must provide usufruct (usable benefits). Rent is only charged after the asset is handed over.</li>
  <li>The asset must be of a type that allows halal use.</li>
  <li>The lessor (fund owner) is responsible for ownership-related expenses.</li>
  <li>Rental terms must be fixed and known at the start of the contract.</li>
  <li>Management fees may be a fixed amount or a percentage of rental income.</li>
</ul>

<h3>2. Commodity Fund</h3>

<p>Investments are used to purchase and resell commodities for profit. Income is distributed proportionally among investors.</p>

<h4>Shari‘ah Compliance Requirements:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>The fund must own the commodity before selling it.</li>
  <li>Forward sales are prohibited except in salam and istisna’ contracts.</li>
  <li>Commodities must be halal.</li>
  <li>The fund must have physical or constructive possession of commodities before selling.</li>
  <li>The sale price must be fixed and disclosed to both parties.</li>
</ul>

<p>Futures trading in conventional commodity markets does not comply with these conditions, making it impermissible for an Islamic Commodity Fund.</p>

<h3>3. Murabahah Fund</h3>

<p>Uses cost-plus financing (Murabahah) to buy goods and sell them at a markup. Customers purchase goods from the fund on a deferred payment basis. This model is widely used by Islamic banks. Murabahah Fund Must Be a Closed-End Fund so its units cannot be traded in secondary markets.</p>

<h3>4. Bai‘ al-Dayn (Debt Trading) – Prohibited</h3>

<p>Bai‘ al-dayn (sale of debt at a discount) is strictly prohibited in Shari‘ah. If someone has a receivable debt and sells it at a discount (e.g., bill of exchange trading), it falls under riba (interest).</p>

<h4>Rationale for Prohibition:</h4>

<p>A debt is equivalent to money in Shari‘ah. Selling money for a different amount (e.g., $100 for $90) is riba and is not allowed.</p>

<h3>5. Mixed Fund</h3>

<p>Diversified investments: Includes equities, leasing, commodities, etc. If liquid assets (cash, receivables, etc.) exceed 50%, its units cannot be traded per the majority of contemporary scholars. In such a case, the fund must be closed-end.</p>

<h2>The Principles of Limited Liability</h2>

<p>The concept of limited liability has become an essential element of large-scale trade and industry. In modern economic and legal terminology, limited liability refers to a condition where a partner or shareholder of a business is protected from bearing losses beyond the amount they have invested in a company or partnership with limited liability. If the business incurs losses, a shareholder's maximum loss is restricted to their original investment, and their personal assets remain unaffected.</p>

<p>The primary objective of introducing this principle was to encourage investment by assuring investors that their personal wealth would not be at risk. If a limited company’s liabilities exceed its assets, leading to insolvency and liquidation, creditors may lose part of their claims since they can only recover from the liquidated assets and have no recourse to shareholders for the remaining claims.</p>

<h3>Limited Liability and the Concept of Juridical Personality</h3>

<p>The concept of limited liability is closely linked to the juridical personality of modern corporate entities. According to this concept, a joint-stock company is recognized as a separate legal entity, distinct from its individual shareholders. This fictive entity has legal rights and obligations similar to a natural person.</p>

<p>A fundamental question arises: is the concept of a juridical person acceptable in Shari‘ah? If a company, as a juridical person, possesses rights and obligations akin to a natural person, then the same principle applies upon its insolvency. The liquidation of a company is analogous to the death of an individual. Just as a deceased insolvent person’s creditors may suffer losses, the creditors of an insolvent company may also experience losses upon its liquidation.</p>

<p>Although classical Islamic Fiqh does not explicitly discuss the modern concept of juridical personality, there are precedents from which it may be inferred:</p>

<h4>1. Waqf</h4>

<p>A Waqf is a legal and religious institution where an individual dedicates property for a religious or charitable purpose. Once declared as Waqf, the property no longer belongs to the donor, nor do the beneficiaries own it; rather, its ownership vests in Allah.</p>

<p>Key legal principles from Waqf include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A Waqf can own property separately from individuals (See Al-Fatawa al-Hindiyyah, Waqf, Ch. 5).</li>
  <li>Donations made to a mosque do not become part of a Waqf but instead belong to the mosque itself (Al-Fatawa al-Hindiyyah).</li>
  <li>The Maliki jurist Ahmad Al-Dardir validates bequests to mosques, confirming that a mosque can own property.</li>
</ul>

<h4>2. Baitul-Mal</h4>

<p>The Baitul-Mal (Islamic state treasury) is another example of a juridical person. Although all citizens have beneficial rights over it, no individual owns it. Nevertheless, Baitul-Mal has independent rights and obligations. Imam Al-Sarakhsi states in Al-Mabsut (14:33) that Baitul-Mal possesses both rights and obligations.</p>

<h4>3. Joint Stock in Islamic Jurisprudence</h4>

<p>Imam Shafi‘i's Fiqh provides an example akin to a juridical person in joint-stock companies. In a partnership where assets are combined, zakah is levied on the entire joint-stock rather than individual partners. This principle (Khultah-al-Shuyu’) also applies to zakah on livestock and is partially accepted by the Maliki and Hanbali schools.</p>

<h4>4. Inheritance Under Debt</h4>

<p>If a deceased person’s liabilities exceed their estate, the estate is treated as an independent entity until debts are settled. Jurists confirm that such an estate neither belongs to the deceased, their heirs, nor the creditors. This treatment mirrors the concept of a juridical person since the estate holds legal standing until debts are cleared.</p>

<h4>5. Limited Liability in the Case of Slaves</h4>

<p>The closest analogy to modern limited liability is found in the historical institution of slavery. A slave permitted to trade (mudabbar) operated with capital provided by their master. The master owned all profits and capital, yet if the slave incurred debts, creditors could only claim from the slave’s stock and cash or, ultimately, by selling the slave. If debts remained unpaid even after the slave’s death, creditors had no claim on the master’s personal assets.</p>

<p>This principle closely resembles limited liability in joint-stock companies, where an investor’s liability is restricted to their investment, and creditors cannot claim beyond the corporate assets.</p>

<h3>Limitations on the Application of Limited Liability in Islam</h3>

<p>While limited liability is supported by Islamic precedents, it must not be used to deceive creditors or evade legitimate financial responsibilities. Therefore, its application should be restricted:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Public Companies:</strong> The principle should be applied to public companies where shares are widely held, and individual shareholders cannot be held personally liable.</li>
  <li><strong>Private Companies and Partnerships:</strong> Limited liability should not apply to private companies and partnerships where partners actively manage the business. However, sleeping partners (investors who do not participate in business operations) may have limited liability, provided there is an explicit agreement among partners.</li>
</ul>

<p>By maintaining these restrictions, Shari‘ah ensures that the concept of limited liability does not become a tool for unethical financial practices while still enabling business growth and investment.</p>
<h2><strong>Conclusion</strong>:</h2> <p>Islamic Financing is a very vast topic we tried to present to you a very brief understanding.
